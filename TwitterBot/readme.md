This bot was made by following the instructions on :
https://hackernoon.com/create-a-simple-twitter-bot-with-node-js-5b14eb006c08

All the files from this project can be used directly(Although, you'll need to install node modules with 'npm install' command in the folder and also Twit with 'npm install --save twit' command ) with changes to be done in config.js file for key and token values.
Additional changes can be done in 'bot.js -> params -> q' for personalization.  

After that run 'npm start' or 'node bot.js' command in the folder location and it's done :)
